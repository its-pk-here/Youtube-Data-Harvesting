# Youtube-Data-Harvesting
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
   To develop a Streamlit application that enables users to obtain and examine data from numerous YouTube channels is the stated problem. Using the Youtube API to extract data, saving it in MongoDB, and then converting it to a table in postgresSQL, for obtaining different information about YouTube channels.

## PREREQUISITES:  
  ### Python  
  ### MongoDB  
  ### PostgreSQL  
  ### StreamLit

## INSTALLATION AND SETUP:

### Follow these steps to manage the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project:  

1.Install Python on your computer by following these simple instructions.  

2.Install Required Libraries: Make use of pip to install the required Python libraries.  

3.The libraries Streamlit, MongoDB driver, psycopg2, and Pandas are required.  

4.Configure Google API: Create a Google API project and get the API credentials required to access the YouTube API.  

5.Set up the databases: Create a MongoDB database and a SQL Table to store the data.  

6.Configure Application: Add the required API credentials and database connection information to the configuration file or environment variables.  

7.Run the Application: Launch the Streamlit application using the command-line interface.  

## CONCLUSION  
For gathering, storing, and analysing YouTube channel and video data, a potent tool is offered by the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing initiative. Users may quickly access and modify YouTube data in a user-friendly interface by utilising SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit. The project enables users to get insights from the large amount of available YouTube data by providing flexibility, scalability, and data visualisation capabilities.
